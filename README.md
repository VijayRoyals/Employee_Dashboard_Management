This is the backend for the Employee Management Dashboard. 
The backend exposes APIs to interact with employee data (create, read, update, delete). 
It is built with Node.js and Express and communicates with a database to persist employee data.

Employee Filtering: The GET /employees endpoint supports query parameters to filter employees by:
